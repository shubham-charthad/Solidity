Event Solidity smart contract provides a decentralized solution for managing events. It allows organizers to create events and attendees to purchase, hold, and transfer tickets securely.

Features:

Event Creation:
Organizers can create events with details like name, date, price, and ticket count.
Events must have a future date and a valid ticket count.

Ticket Purchase:
Users can buy tickets by sending Ether equal to the price of the tickets.
The contract ensures that the event exists, has not expired, and has enough remaining tickets.

Ticket Transfer:
Users can transfer their tickets to another address.
The contract ensures the sender has enough tickets and that the event has not expired.
